📄 Technical Process Map (TPM)

Purpose
A Technical Process Map (TPM) documents the step-by-step logic and data flow of a business process before building it in Anaplan 
It helps ensure alignment across business and technical stakeholders and serves as the build blueprint

🔧 How to Create a TPM
  ** This is visualization used to show data flow from upstream-most environment to the downstream-most**
    -- In simpler terms, imagine you have Workday data that flows to PowerBI with Anaplan in the middle 
        -- Your job is simply to show how that data flows using arrows in a chronological manner
        -- We will show you how to get there with examples but this page serves as checklist for now!
  > Understand the Business Process
  > Interview SMEs
  > Observe current process (manual or system-based)
  > Identify inputs, calculations, and outputs
  > Draft the Flow
  > Break down the process into clear steps
  > Map inputs (source systems or lists), transformations (calculations), and outputs (UX or exports)
  > List modules and line items needed per step
  > Keep It Simple
  > Use short sentences or bullet points
  > Avoid over-explaining formulas—just reference them
  > Use “Input → Logic → Output” format per step

📥 Intake Items (Before Building)
 > Business objective
 > User stories or use cases
 > Key assumptions
 > Required inputs and their sources
 > Desired outputs (reports, dashboards, exports)
 > Stakeholders and approvers
 > Security/access requirements
 > Expected update frequency (daily, monthly, etc.)

📣 Socializing the TPM
 > Review with SME and confirm logic
 > Review with Architect/Builder to align on feasibility
 > Capture open questions and decisions
 > Final sign-off before build starts

✅ Tips for a Successful TPM
 > Write for someone not in the meeting—TPM should speak for itself
 > Don’t skip edge cases—document exceptions and data anomalies
 > Highlight dependencies (e.g. relies on Data Hub load)
 > Use consistent formatting (module names, dimensions)
 > Save version history (TPM v1, v2, etc.)
