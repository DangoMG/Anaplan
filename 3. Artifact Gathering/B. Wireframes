🧩 Wireframes
Purpose
Wireframes visually represent the layout and navigation of Anaplan pages and dashboards before development begins. They ensure alignment on UX design, user roles, and data flow before a single module is built.

✍️ How to Create a Wireframe
Start with the User
Who is the user (role)?
What decisions or actions will they take on this page?
Define Page Type
Worksheet: For data entry, heavy analysis
Board: For dashboards, visual storytelling
Report: For polished executive summaries
Layout the Structure
Header: Page title, selectors (Time, Version, Cost Center, etc.)
Body: Grids, charts, cards, KPIs, filters
Footer (optional): Notes, links, comments
Mock Before You Build
Use Miro, Figma, Lucidchart, or even PowerPoint
Keep it low-fidelity—boxes, labels, arrows are enough

📥 Intake Items (Before Wireframing)
Persona or user role
Page objectives
KPIs or summary metrics
Editable vs. read-only requirements
Required filters (time, versions, regions, etc.)
Expected navigation flow (drill-downs, links)

📣 Socializing the Wireframe
Walk through wireframe with end users early
Align with model builders on feasibility
Capture feedback and revise before development
Link the final wireframe to the TPM for traceability

✅ Tips for a Successful Wireframe
Less is more—highlight key data, hide noise
Use consistent terms (e.g. “Department” vs. “Cost Center”)
Group related data—use sections or tabs
Keep a clean visual hierarchy (title → filters → data → insights)
Design mobile-friendly if applicable
