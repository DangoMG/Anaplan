Below are typical questions for L1/L2:
Q = Question
C = (Assessment) Criteria
A = Answer (Framing)

Q: What is Anaplan and how does it differ from traditional Excel-based planning?
C: (Tests general understanding and comparison skills)
A: Anaplan is a cloud-based (SaaS), enterprise-grade planning platform that enables dynamic, collaborative, and real-time planning across finance, sales, supply chain, 
workforce, and other business functions that sits on AWS/GCP servers; built on a patented in-memory calculation engine called Hyperblock, which 
allows for fast calculations and data updates across large, complex datasets

Q: What are modules, lists, and line items in Anaplan?
C: (Fundamental building blocks of Anaplan)
A: Lists = the dimensions | Modules = the workspace where planning happens | Line Items = the data/calculations inside module

Q: What is the difference between a model and a workspace?
C: (Understanding the platform structure)
A: Workspace = container that holds one or more models and is tied to a specific amount of memory and user access | Model = individual 
planning environment within a workspace that contains modules, lists, dashboards, and data used for a specific business process or use case

Q: What is a numbered list and when would you use it?
C: (Useful for use cases like employee or transaction-level detail)
A: Numbered list is a type of list in Anaplan where items are identified by system-generated numbers instead of names | It’s used when list items may 
have duplicate names (e.g., multiple employees with the same name) or when you need to store transactional or detailed records like logs, comments, 
or line items with similar label

Q: Explain the purpose and use of a system module (SYS module)?
C: (Testing knowledge of model architecture best practices)
A: System modules are used to store metadata, mappings, and filters related to lists or dimensions; used create intersection (relationships) and to
keep calculations clean by separating logic from data and improves model performance and maintainability by centralizing commonly used references

Q: What is a line item subset and when is it used?
C: (Shows ability to build dynamic reporting or calculations)
A: Line-Item Subset (LiSS) is a custom list created from selected line items across a module, which is used when you need to apply calculations, filters, or mappings to a group of 
line items as if they were list items—commonly in reporting, driver-based calculations, or KPI aggregations

Q: What are summary methods in Anaplan? How do they affect calculations?
C: (Helps evaluate performance and accuracy understanding)
A: Summary methods define how data is aggregated across dimensions like time, hierarchy, or versions (Ex. include SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and NONE); They affect calcs by determining how 
parent levels or totals are calculated, impacting both accuracy and performance of the model

Q: What is the difference between a formula and a function in Anaplan?
C: (Testing how well you understand syntax vs. business logic)
A: 

Q: How does time dimension work in Anaplan? Can you customize it?
C: (Checks knowledge of time-based modeling)
A:

Q: What is ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) in Anaplan? Have you used it before?
C: (Even at L1, basic awareness of Dev vs. Prod models is useful)
A:

Q: Explain the use of Selective Access in Anaplan. How do you implement it?
C: (Tests understanding of user security and access controls)
A:

Q: What is a Data Hub, and why is it important in model design?
C: (Shows awareness of scalable architecture)
A: 

Q: Have you worked with import/export actions in Anaplan? How do you handle failed imports?
C: (Practical experience with data integration)
A: 

Q: What is a saved view and how is it different from a module view?
C: (Important for creating imports/exports and dashboards)
A: 

What are some best practices for improving model performance?
(Shows awareness of scalability and efficiency)
