/// Anaplan L2/L3 Interview Questions (Theory) ///

Below are typical questions for L2/L3:
Q = Question
C = (Assessment) Criteria
A = Answer (Framing)

------------------------------------------
--- Design Frameworks & Best Practices ---
------------------------------------------
Q: What is DISCO in Anaplan and why is it important?
C: (Evaluating Anaplan BDP practices, organization, and understanding of naming conventions)
A: DISCO stands for Data, Input, System, Calculation, Output—a modeling structure that organizes modules by function. It improves clarity, scalability, and performance by separating concerns

Q: What is PLANS and how is it used in Anaplan?
C: (Evaluating knowledge of design principles, model governance, and ability to build scalable models)
A: PLANS stands for Performance, Logic, Auditable, Necessary, Sustainable. It’s Anaplan’s design standard for building efficient, maintainable models and drives thoughtful structuring of logic and naming

Q: How would you handle sparsity in a large model?
C: (Understanding development practices around scale and futureproofing)
A: Reduce sparsity by minimizing dimensions in modules, using conditional logic, and filtering with booleans. Separate high-granularity data and only aggregate when needed

Q: What is the impact of using TEXT formatted line items in large models?
C: (Testing understanding of memory usage, optimization, and performance trade-offs)
A: TEXT line items are memory-intensive and slow down performance. Use sparingly, and avoid in modules that span large hierarchies or time scales

--------------------------------------
--- Versioning & Forecasting Logic ---
--------------------------------------
Q: Explain the concept of versionization
C: (Scenario planning and use of time + version logic across modules)
A: Versionization means creating parallel versions (Actual, Budget, Forecast) of the same dataset. It allows scenario comparisons using either native or custom versions

Q: What are the pros and cons of Native vs Custom Version Lists?
C: (Architecture decision-making and ALM awareness)
A: Native Versions support switchover and ALM but lack flexibility across modules. Custom Versions offer full control but require manual logic and don't support native features like switchover

Q: How do you implement Version Switchover logic?
C: (Analyzing understanding of version setup and configuration)
A: Switchover allows actuals to flow into forecast versions automatically from a set date in Native Versions. It simplifies rolling forecasts and reduces manual effort

Q: How would you build a rolling forecast model in Anaplan?
C: (Testing dynamic filtering, time-based logic, and forecasting automation)
A: Use a time filter module (e.g., ITEM(Time) >= Current Month) and apply it across planning modules. Combine with dynamic versions or custom time ranges to support rolling periods

----------------------------------------------
--- Security, Integration & Authentication ---
----------------------------------------------
Q: What is CloudWorks and how does it work? What are the 3 external CSPs native to it?
C: (Testing knowledge of native integrations, scheduling, and cloud services)
A: CloudWorks is Anaplan’s native tool for scheduling and automating data integrations. The 3 supported CSPs are AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage

Q: How does BYOK work?
C: (Understanding data encryption, ownership, and enterprise security)
A: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) allows organizations to encrypt data using their own Azure Key Vault-managed keys. It supports control over key access, rotation, and audit

Q: Explain what type of certificate CA integration uses and why
C: (Secure integration method and certificate-based API access)
A: CA (Certificate Authority) integrations use X.509 certificates (S/MIME) issued by a trusted provider. These enable secure, passwordless authentication using public/private key pairs

Q: What is OAuth2.0 and how is it setup?
C: (Modern authentication protocol and integration security setup)
A: OAuth2.0 enables secure API access using client credentials. You register a client in Admin Console, generate a Client ID and Secret, and use them to retrieve access tokens for authentication

---------------------------------------------
--- Calculation Logic & Model Performance ---
---------------------------------------------
Q: Why can’t you use LOOKUP and SUM together?
C: (Testing understanding of function directionality and dimensionality)
A: LOOKUP pulls data based on a source mapping; SUM aggregates data based on a target mapping. Using both creates a direction conflict and causes formula errors

Q: How do you use the LOOKUP function, and when would you use SUM instead?
C: (Distinguishing technical fluency between junior and senior builders)
A: Use LOOKUP when retrieving specific data by a single mapping (e.g., employee to cost center). Use SUM when aggregating values by dimension (e.g., total expenses by department)

Q: How do time ranges improve performance and model design?
C: (Model optimization and sparsity management)
A: Time Ranges reduce unnecessary calculations by scoping modules to specific periods. This lowers memory usage and improves performance

Q: What are dynamic cell access (DCA) and how do you use it?
C: (User-level access control implementation)
A: DCA controls read/write access at the cell level using boolean line items. Set access drivers in the line item’s settings to restrict editing or viewing

Q: How do you debug a complex formula that isn’t working?
C: (Problem-solving, modular thinking, and familiarity with Anaplan’s tools)
A: Break down the formula using temporary helper line items. Use drill-down, formula viewer, and dimensional analysis to isolate the issue

-----------------------------------------------------------
--- Governance & ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) ---
-----------------------------------------------------------
Q: What are revision tags and how are they used in ALM?
C: (Change control and lifecycle understanding)
A: Revision tags are checkpoints in the Dev model used to sync updates to Production. They ensure only tested, approved changes are deployed

Q: Explain what Production Data does when checked for the list
C: (ALM configuration and separation of data/model structures)
A: When Production Data is checked, list items can be modified in Production without requiring a model sync. This supports live updates while preserving model structure
