/// Anaplan Solution Architect / Master Anaplanner Interview Questions (Theory Only ///

/// Tip: Don't let the insecurities of the interviewer become yours... ///

Below are typical questions for Solution Architects:
Q = Question
C = (Assessment) Criteria
A = Answer (Framing)

----------------------------------------------
--- Model Architecture & Design Principles ---
----------------------------------------------
Q: What is the DISCO methodology and how do you apply it in large-scale model design?
C: (Gauging knowledge of Anaplan design best practices and ability to build clean, scalable models)
A: DISCO stands for Data, Input, System, Calculation, and Output; it structures models for clarity, reusability, and scalability

Q: How do you design for scalability in multi-model architecture with multiple business functions (e.g., FP&A, Workforce, Sales)?
C: (Assessing big-picture thinking and cross-functional model architecture planning)
A: By modularizing use cases, using Data Hubs, aligning metadata across models, and enforcing naming and structural standards

Q: Explain the difference between spoke-to-spoke vs. spoke-to-hub integration models
C: (Looking for understanding of centralized vs. decentralized data strategies)
A: Spoke-to-hub centralizes data through a hub, while spoke-to-spoke connects models directly, risking duplication and governance issues

Q: What are some trade-offs when using native versions vs. custom versioning in enterprise models?
C: (Checking depth in versioning strategy and enterprise planning logic)
A: Native versions support switchover and ALM, but custom versions offer greater flexibility in module design and access control

Q: How do you decide between creating a new model vs. expanding an existing model in a production workspace?
C: (Testing decision-making skills and model governance awareness)
A: Based on factors like workspace capacity, performance, user role segmentation, and architectural complexity

------------------------------------------------
--- Performance Optimization & Data Modeling ---
------------------------------------------------
Q: How does sparsity impact model performance and how do you mitigate it?
C: (Evaluating performance optimization skills and data modeling efficiency)
A: Sparsity wastes memory and slows down calculations; mitigate it by reducing dimensions, using filtering logic, and creating lean modules

Q: What role does time range optimization play in large models?
C: (Checking awareness of time-based tuning strategies)
A: It limits calculations to only relevant periods, improving performance and memory efficiency

Q: Why is TEXT a performance concern, and how do you reduce reliance on it in planning models?
C: (Looking for practical performance knowledge and modeling discipline)
A: TEXT is heavy on memory and CPU; avoid it by using list-formatted line items and boolean flags when possible

Q: How do summary methods impact calculation time and memory usage?
C: (Assessing detailed knowledge of model calculation tuning)
A: Improper summary methods can cause unnecessary aggregation; using "None" or "Formula" where appropriate reduces load

Q: What are the benefits of separating calculation modules from reporting modules in complex solutions?
C: (Looking for understanding of clean architecture and maintainability)
A: It improves traceability, modularity, and performance by reducing redundant calculations in reporting views

----------------------------------
--- Governance, Security & ALM ---
----------------------------------
Q: What are revision tags and how do they support the ALM process?
C: (Testing ALM process knowledge and release control)
A: Revision tags snapshot model changes and are used to sync structural updates between Dev and Prod safely

Q: How do you manage model syncs across multiple environments when models are dependent on one another?
C: (Checking experience with multi-model governance)
A: By coordinating sync schedules, freezing structural changes, and ensuring upstream changes are compatible downstream

Q: What is the difference between Production Data and Structural Data in ALM?
C: (Gauging understanding of ALM configuration and runtime flexibility)
A: Structural data defines the model build, while production data (like list items marked as production) can change in live models without syncs

Q: How do you implement Dynamic Cell Access (DCA) in a model that has multiple user roles with overlapping access needs?
C: (Testing security configuration skills and user-level logic building)
A: By building role-based boolean drivers and layering them using OR logic to allow multi-role access

Q: What’s your strategy for handling user access across multiple models and workspaces?
C: (Evaluating scalability and governance in access management)
A: Centralized access control via user modules or access lists, often managed in the Data Hub and synced to all models

---------------------------------------------
--- Integration & Enterprise Architecture ---
---------------------------------------------
Q: What are the advantages of using CloudWorks over external ETL tools for data integration?
C: (Testing tool selection judgment and platform familiarity)
A: CloudWorks is native, easier to configure, and doesn’t require third-party licensing, ideal for basic scheduling and integrations

Q: Explain how OAuth2.0 works in the context of secure API integrations with Anaplan
C: (Checking modern security protocol knowledge and integration competency)
A: OAuth2.0 authenticates integrations using client credentials to retrieve tokens instead of hardcoded usernames/passwords

Q: What are the key considerations when integrating Anaplan with a Customer Data Platform (CDP) like Snowflake or Redshift?
C: (Evaluating enterprise integration thinking and data pipeline awareness)
A: Data freshness, schema alignment, authentication, scheduling, and maintaining a clean data layer in the Data Hub

Q: How does BYOK enhance data security in highly regulated industries?
C: (Looking for understanding of security features relevant to regulated environments)
A: BYOK lets companies use their own encryption keys to protect data, allowing control over access, rotation, and revocation

Q: When building a solution architecture, how do you collaborate with IT and business stakeholders to ensure alignment?
C: (Testing communication, stakeholder management, and holistic solutioning skills)
A: By running design sessions, creating wireframes, validating use cases, and aligning data flows and access requirements with both groups
