/// Anaplan L1/L2 Interview Questions (Theory) ///

Below are typical questions for L1/L2:
Q = Question
C = (Assessment) Criteria
A = Answer (Framing)

-----------------------------------------
--- Platform & Conceptual Foundations ---
-----------------------------------------

Q: What is Anaplan and how does it differ from traditional Excel-based planning?
C: (Tests general understanding and comparison skills)
A: Anaplan is a cloud-based (SaaS), enterprise-grade planning platform that enables dynamic, collaborative, and real-time planning across finance, sales, supply chain, 
workforce, and other business functions that sits on AWS/GCP servers; built on a patented in-memory calculation engine called Hyperblock, which 
allows for fast calculations and data updates across large, complex datasets

Q: Can you explain the concept of Hub-to-Spoke as it pertains to Anaplan?
C: (Looking for both functional/technical conceptualization of the relationship/flow of data)
A: In Anaplan, a hub is considered the upstream-most, centralized model (generally the Data Hub) that receives initial inbound data that is then distributed to the appropriate
downstream model(s) (ex. Comp Expense Planning, Topline, OpEx, etc.); purpose is to delineate functional data from raw data + helps manage sparsity

Q: What is the difference between a model and a workspace?
C: (Understanding the platform structure)
A: Workspace = container that holds one or more models and is tied to a specific amount of memory and user access | Model = individual 
planning environment within a workspace that contains modules, lists, dashboards, and data used for a specific business process or use case

----------------------------------
--- Core Model Building Blocks ---
----------------------------------

Q: What is a numbered list and when would you use it?
C: (Useful for use cases like employee or transaction-level detail)
A: Numbered list is a type of list in Anaplan where items are identified by system-generated numbers instead of names | It’s used when list items may 
have duplicate names (e.g., multiple employees with the same name) or when you need to store transactional or detailed records like logs, comments, 
or line items with similar label

Q: When do we want to use a numbered list vs non-numbered list?
C: (Testing knowledge of list structure use cases, data uniqueness handling, and UI behavior)
A: Use a numbered list when items may have duplicate display names (e.g., multiple employees named "John Smith") or when capturing transactional data with unique IDs; use a non-numbered list 
when items have unique names and don’t require display name overrides, as they’re easier to read and manage in formulas and dashboards

Q: What is a line item subset and when is it used?
C: (Shows ability to build dynamic reporting or calculations)
A: Line-Item Subset (LiSS) is a custom list created from selected line items across a module, which is used when you need to apply calculations, filters, or mappings to a group of 
line items as if they were list items—commonly in reporting, driver-based calculations, or KPI aggregations

Q: Explain the purpose and use of a system module (SYS module)?
C: (Testing knowledge of model architecture best practices)
A: System modules are used to store metadata, mappings, and filters related to lists or dimensions; used create intersection (relationships) and to
keep calculations clean by separating logic from data and improves model performance and maintainability by centralizing commonly used references

Q: What are modules, lists, and line items in Anaplan?
C: (Fundamental building blocks of Anaplan)
A: Lists = the dimensions | Modules = the workspace where planning happens | Line Items = the data/calculations inside module

--------------------------------------
--- Time, Version, & Summary Logic ---
--------------------------------------

Q: How does the time dimension work in Anaplan? Can you customize it?
C: (Time-based modeling awareness)
A: The time dimension is built-in and supports months, quarters, and years. You can customize it with time ranges, fiscal year starts, and time scales

Q: What are summary methods in Anaplan? How do they affect calculations?
C: (Evaluates understanding of calculation performance)
A: Summary methods control how data is aggregated (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, NONE). They impact performance and how parent data is calculated

Q: What is the difference between a formula and a function in Anaplan?
C: (Syntax vs logic understanding)
A: A formula is the full expression written in a line item. A function (like SUM, LOOKUP) is a specific operation used inside a formula

Q: What is ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) in Anaplan? Have you used it before?
C: (Basic Dev vs. Prod model awareness)
A: ALM enables safe model updates between Dev and Prod through revision tags and model syncs. Yes, I’ve used ALM to move structural changes into production safely

---------------------------------------
--- Security, Access, & Integration ---
---------------------------------------

Q: Explain the use of Selective Access in Anaplan. How do you implement it?
C: (User access control awareness)
A: Selective Access limits access to list items by user. It’s enabled at the list level and assigned via the Users page or import actions, often staged through a SYS module

Q: What is a Data Hub, and why is it important in model design?
C: (Shows scalable model architecture awareness)
A: A Data Hub acts as a central source for raw/staged data. It improves data integrity and reduces duplication across spoke models

Q: Have you worked with import/export actions in Anaplan? How do you handle failed imports?
C: (Practical experience with data integration)
A: Yes—I've used import/export actions for data and metadata. For failed imports, I review error logs, validate mappings, and fix file formats

Q: What is a saved view and how is it different from a module view?
C: (Reporting and integration familiarity)
A: A saved view is a custom layout of a module with filters and selections. It’s used for dashboards and integrations, unlike default module views

-------------------------------
--- Integration & Data Flow ---
-------------------------------

Q: Can you explain how data flows to, through, and beyond Anaplan?
C: (Understanding of end-to-end architecture and data flow)
A: Data enters Anaplan from ERP/CRM systems through ETL or CloudWorks, is staged in a Data Hub, flows into spoke models, and can be exported to BI tools or data lakes

Q: What is an ETL pipeline and how is it setup?
C: (Integration tool selection and flow logic)
A: ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It’s set up using tools like Boomi or CloudWorks, with mappings and schedules for automated flow into Anaplan

Q: How is data orchestration setup as it pertains to Workday to CDP to Anaplan?
C: (Enterprise-level integration flow awareness)
A: Workday feeds into a CDP (e.g., Snowflake) where data is staged and enriched. That data is then pushed to Anaplan’s Data Hub via APIs or CloudWorks for planning

------------------------------------
--- Performance & Best Practices ---
------------------------------------

Q: What are some best practices for improving model performance?
C: (Scalability and efficiency awareness)
A: Use system modules, limit TEXT and IF/ELSE usage, minimize dimensions, apply appropriate summary methods, and archive unused objects regularly
