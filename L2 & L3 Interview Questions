Below are typical questions for L2/L3:
Q = Question
C = (Assessment) Criteria
A = Answer (Framing)

Q: What is DISCO in Anaplan and why is it important?
C: (Evaluating Anaplan BDP practices, organization, and understanding of naming conventions)
A: DISCO stands for Data, Input, System, Calculation, Output—a modeling structure that organizes modules by function; improves model clarity, 
scalability, and performance by separating concerns, making maintenance and debugging easier

Q: How would you handle sparsity in a large model?
C: (Aiming to understand developement practices around futureproofing and building for scale)
A: To reduce sparsity, avoid over-dimensioning modules and use boolean filters, line item subsets, and conditional calculations; split 
high-granularity data into separate modules and aggregate only when needed

Q: Explain the concept of versionization
C: (Assessing ability to design multi-scenario planning, and use of time + version logic across modules)
A: Versionization is the process of creating separate versions (e.g., Actual, Budget, Forecast) of the same data set for scenario analysis; allows comparing multiple 
planning outcomes and typically uses either native versions or a custom version list to apply logic across the model

Q: What are the pros and cons of Native vs Custom Version Lists?
C: (Testing architecture decision-making, ALM knowledge, and model flexibility awareness)
A: Native Versions support built-in features like switchover, version formulas, and comparison reports, and work well with ALM. However, they're limited in 
customization and can’t be selectively applied across modules; custom Versions (using a list) offer full flexibility and selective use in modules, but lack native features 
and require more manual setup

Q: Why can't you use LOOKUP & SUM together?
C: (Evaluating understanding of function mechanics, dimensional context, and modeling accuracy)
A: You can't use LOOKUP and SUM together because they both operate on different directions—LOOKUP pulls data based on a mapping, while SUM aggregates based on a 
target mapping; using both would create ambiguity about whether to pull or aggregate the data, which leads to a dimensionality mismatch and a formula error

Q: Explain what Production Data does when checked for the list
C: (Checking knowledge of ALM configuration, data/model separation, and revision safety)
A: When Production Data is checked on a list, it means that list items can be added or modified directly in Production without impacting the structural model; ensures that list
changes don’t require a sync from Dev and protects the integrity of the deployed model during ALM processes

Q: How do you use the LOOKUP function, and when would you use SUM instead?
C: (Aiming to vet out junior vs senior model builders and their technical comprehension of Anaplan)
A: Use LOOKUP when pulling data based on a single mapping (like employee to department); use SUM when aggregating values across dimensions, such as summing expenses by cost center

Q: How do time ranges improve performance and model design?
C: (Focused on understanding sparsity management and model optimization)
A: Time ranges allow you to apply custom date spans to modules instead of the full model calendar; improves performance by reducing unnecessary calculations and memory usage

Q: What are dynamic cell access (DCA) and how do you use it?
C: (Looking to understand how builders manage access control in Anaplan)
A: DCA is used to control read/write access at the cell level using boolean drivers; apply it by referencing boolean line items in the Read Access Driver or Write Access 
Driver settings of a line item

Q: How do you implement Version Switchover logic?
C: (Analyzing interviewees understanding of the inner-workings of Anaplan configurations)
A: In Native Versions, use Switchover to pull actuals into forecast versions automatically based on a set date;ensures continuity of data and simplifies 
rolling forecasts by eliminating manual copying of actuals

Q: What is the impact of using TEXT formatted line items in large models?
C: (Testing understanding of data type optimization, model memory consumption, and performance trade-offs)
A: TEXT line items are more memory-intensive and can slow down model performance, especially when heavily used in calculations; use them sparingly and avoid in 
modules that aggregate over large dimensions

Q: How would you build a rolling forecast model in Anaplan?
C: (Checking for skills in dynamic filtering, time-based logic building, and forecasting automation)
A: Use a time filter module with logic to dynamically show current and future months (e.g., ITEM(Time) >= Current Month); combine with dynamic versions or custom time 
ranges to maintain rolling logic without needing to rebuild each period

Q: How do you debug a complex formula that isn’t working?
C: (Evaluating problem-solving approach, modular thinking, and familiarity with Anaplan's debugging tools)
A: Break the formula into smaller parts using temporary helper line items to isolate issues; use drill-down and show formula features, and check that 
data types and dimensionality match across components

Q: What are revision tags and how are they used in ALM?
C: (Gauging understanding of model governance, change management process, and ALM best practices)
A: Revision tags are version snapshots of a development model used in Application Lifecycle Management (ALM); allow you to promote only tested and approved 
changes to the production model through model synchronization
